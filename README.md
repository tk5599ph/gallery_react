# React Gallery Application [React + Vite]

This is a simple Gallery application built using React and Vite for practice. It demonstrates the use of React components and dynamic rendering with the map function. The app features a responsive grid layout with fast performance.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
